Running this code using `quarto render .\python_syntax_error_bug_reprex.qmd`



# Error number 1

```{python}
#| error: true


8* *2

```

Hmmm, this works here but is not working in the book :(





# Error number 2 

This gives an error on my Windows computer but works fine on my mac. It seems that an extra space is being added before each underscore in my path in Windows (there are no spaces in the real path)


```{python}
#| error: true
#| eval: false   

# adding eval: fals so that I can debug why the first piece of code is not causing the document to fail to knit

# There is a limited size to integers (although the size is pretty large)

1234567 ** 890 


```

The above still does not work and gives the error message



This is the error message given for Error number 2

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
